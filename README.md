# AutoKEGGRec
AutoKEGGRec is an automated tool for Matlab that creates first draft metabolic network reconstructions of single organisms, community reconstructions based on a list of organisms, and finally a consolidated reconstruction for a list of organisms. All reconstructions are based on data downloaded from KEGG during the reconstruction process.
